# Face-Controlled-Game-Player
A real-time face movement tracking system that allows users to control computer games using facial gestures. Built using Python, OpenCV, MediaPipe, and PyAutoGUI, the project maps nose movement to arrow key presses, enabling hands-free interaction with games like Subway Surfers.
